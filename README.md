## Introduction
Welcome to my first *low level programming project*! this project is based on self written C code scripts following the betty coding and documentation style. The main purpose of this project for me was to learn the basic and advanced programming concepts using C.
## Content
This repository contains two folders (by far):
1. **0x00-hello_world**
2. **0x01-variables_if_else_while**


*Note: This project is still a work in progress. The content section is **always** subject to change.*
